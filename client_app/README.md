This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Project setup
This project relies heavily on React Hooks and uses Redux for global state management and API calls.

When working locally, or hosting your back-end server somewhere separate from where this app is hosted, it's important to create a `.env` file with something similar to below:

```
REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5000
```
